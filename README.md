Good work and thank you!


How to install:



    git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
    
    git clone https://github.com/dduuch/my-python-vim.git && cd my-python-vim && mv .vimrc ~/ && mv colors  ~/.vim/


Its still pre alpha config. YouCompleteMe config is better done. You can find it in another branch.
For my own use.
